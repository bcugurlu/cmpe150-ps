# PS-4 Questions

### **Q1) Guess the number!**

Write a program for a game that takes an integer between 0 and 10 (including the limits), and determines if this integer is equal to a randomly selected integer.

When the randomly selected number (X) is equal to the guessed value, then game adds 10 points.

When the guessed value is in the interval [X-2, X+2], but not equal to X, then game adds 3 points.

### **Q2) Remove A**

Given several integers in a row, write a program to remove all occurrences of a given number A and print the modified list of these integers.

Input | Output
--- | ---
1 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 7 8 8 8 9 9 <br> 5 | [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9]

### **Q3) Duplicate Elements**

**a)** Given several integers in a row, write a program to print the list of these integers without duplicate elements.

Input | Output
--- | ---
1 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 7 8 8 8 9 9 | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
23 34 27 18 27 10 11 6 11 11 8 | [23, 34, 27, 18, 10, 11, 6, 8]

**b)** Given several integers in a row, write a program to find the number of occurrences of elements that occur at least three times.

Input | Output
--- | ---
1 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 7 8 8 8 9 9 | 3 3 <br> 5 4 <br> 8 3

### **Q4) Transpose of a Matrix**

Write a program that takes an integer (M), then takes a MxN matrix, and prints the transpose of this matrix.

Input | Output
--- | ---
3  <br> 1 2 3 4 5 6  <br> 7 8 9 10 11 12 <br> 13 14 15 16 17 18 | 1 7 13  <br> 2 8 14 <br> 3 9 15  <br> 4 10 16 <br> 5 11 17 <br> 6 12 18
